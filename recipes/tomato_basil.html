    <h1>Tomato Basil Soup</h1>
    <img src="/Users/ainaracapelmariscal/repos/odin-recipes/recipes/tomato_basil.jpeg" alt="Image of the Recipe">
    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>This tastes just like the tomato basil soup they serve at Applebee's®. The hubs loved it so that's saying something! I always add a pinch of sugar to tomato-based sauce, but I'm not sure that it needed it. Served it with baked fries with seasoned salt and grilled gouda cheese sandwiches on thick crusty bread, panini-style.</p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>3 tablespoons olive oil</li>
        <li>1 small clove garlic, minced</li>
        <li>1 (10.75 ounce) can condensed tomato soup</li>
        <li>¼ cup bottled marinara sauce</li>
        <li>½ (10.75 ounce) can water</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon chopped fresh oregano, or to taste</li>
        <li>½ teaspoon ground black pepper</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon chopped fresh basil, or more to taste</li>
        <li>6 Italian-style seasoned croutons, or as needed</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons grated Parmesan cheese</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Heat olive oil in a large saucepan over medium heat. Saute garlic in hot oil until tender and fragrant, 2 to 3 minutes. Stir</li>
        <li>Stir condensed tomato soup and marinara sauce into garlic; slowly add water. Mix oregano and black pepper into soup; bring to a simmer, reduce heat to low, and cook until flavors blend, about 15 minutes. Stir basil into soup. Ladle into bowls and top with croutons and Parmesan cheese.</li>
    </ol>
